- Conditional rendering:
    -> Inline If with Logical && Operator: 
        -> (condition && #statement)      eg: true && "hi"  //"hi"
        -> It can be handy for conditionally including an element

    -> Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator:  
        -> ternary operator: (condition ? #statement1 : #statement2)      eg: true ? "hi" : "bye"   //"hi"


- key attribute:
    -> The key attribute is very important for react to indicate which of the children in a tree were changed and which stayed unchanged.
    -> key attribute shouldn't be filled with index argument (or any inconsistent source), because it causes performance issues.
    -> If we add an element in the beginning of an array it shifts the index for rest of the elements. So react will mutate all of these children.(ie, unshit method i think so)
