- JSX:
    -> “components” that contain both markup(HTML like structure) and logic(ja or react)
    -> React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid(help/assist) when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. 
    -> It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
